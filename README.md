A Demo app built in vue js with server side rendering and client side hydration

```
npm install
```

2. First run the application in production mode 

```
npm run prod
```

3. Point the browser to:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

## Development Environment

All commands can also be found in the package.json scripts

1. Open a shell and run:

```
npm run dev:server
```

2. Open another shell and run:

```
npm run hot
```
